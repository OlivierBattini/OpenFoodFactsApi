# Open Food Facts API

## Project description

This project was created for a technical test, that is create an API to search the [Open Food Facts open database](https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/data) with the following constraints :

- [x] We need to query the API by `code` or `product_name`
- [x] Develop the application using TypeScript
- [x] Ideally, use NestJS
- [x] The project has at least one relevant test
- [x] The API documentation is automatically generated
- [x] **BONUS** : To avoid querying too much the database, implement a caching solution
